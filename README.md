# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This project is based on HTML, CSS and JacaScript code. It's an interactive clone of a Classic Arcade Game.

### How to Play

The game starts automatically. 
You can move the player with the arrow keys "up, down, left and right". 
You need to reach the very top of the map to win the game. When you get hit by an enemy, the game will automatically reset the player object. After reaching the top, an alert will pop up and it shows, how often the player got hit by an enemy. When you decide to play again, the page will automatically relaod and you are ready to go.
